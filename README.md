A super basic Streamlit in Snowflake app, appropriate for doing hands-on workshops for Streamlit beginners.
It comes with sample data.

How to use:
1) load the data for 2021 to Snowflake (for instance by using the Snowsight UI: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-web-ui#create-a-table-when-loading-a-file
2) Create a new Streamlit app in Snowflake (https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/streamlit/getting-started#build-your-first-sis-app) and replace the code with the one from this repo
3) Uncomment the code line by line and see what happens.
4) Now load the data for 2022 into the prevously created table and see how the output of the app changes.
